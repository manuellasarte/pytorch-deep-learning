Reinforced stitching and high-quality zippers would be essential given the stresses of potential flight. The padded straps and back support would require specific ergonomic design and materials.\n\n2. **Booster System Fabrication:** This is the most complex part.\n    * **Miniature Steam Generators:**  These would need to be highly efficient and safe, perhaps utilizing a compact heat source (electric or chemical) to rapidly boil a small amount of water. Materials would need to withstand high temperatures and pressures. Precision machining and possibly 3D printing could be used for components.\n    * **Nozzles and Valves:**  Precisely engineered nozzles and control valves would direct the steam flow for thrust, requiring materials resistant to corrosion and wear.\n    * **Retractable Mechanism:**  A robust, lightweight, and reliable system would be necessary to deploy and retract the boosters. This could involve small electric motors, gears, and linkages, possibly manufactured using a combination of machining and injection molding.\n\n3. **Power System:**\n    * **High-Density Battery:**  A lightweight, high-capacity battery (likely lithium-ion based) would power the steam generators.  Custom battery packs designed for the specific power requirements and form factor would be needed.\n    * **Charging Circuitry:**  Sophisticated charging circuitry with USB-C compatibility would manage the battery charging process and ensure safety.\n\n4. **Control System:** This aspect isn't explicitly mentioned in the sketch but is crucial.  It would likely involve:\n    * **Microcontroller:** A small computer (microcontroller) to manage the booster operation, power distribution, and potentially flight stabilization.\n    * **Sensors:**  Sensors like accelerometers and gyroscopes would provide data to the microcontroller for stable and controlled flight.\n    * **User Interface:** Some form of input controls (buttons, joystick, or voice control) would allow the user to operate the jetpack.\n\n5. **Assembly and Testing:**\n    * **Precision Assembly:**  The various components would be carefully assembled, likely involving a combination of automated and manual processes.\n    * **Rigorous Testing:**  Extensive testing would be crucial to ensure safety and reliability, including tests of the booster system, power system, control system, and overall backpack durability under simulated flight conditions.\n\n6. **Compliance and Certification:** Meeting safety standards and obtaining necessary certifications for airborne devices would be mandatory before commercialization.\n\nThis manufacturing process would involve collaborations with specialists in various fields like materials science, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, software development, and safety certification.  The final product would likely be expensive due to the advanced technology and high manufacturing standards required.\n"

            "[00:00:37] It's an anticyclone, and with no land mass on the planet to slow it down, the Great Red Spot has raged for over a century.\n",
            "[00:00:48] But scientists studying the spot have noticed that it has been changing over time. The color is deepening, and it’s actually shrinking and getting rounder.\n",
            "[00:00:58] Those studying it expected to therefore see the wind speeds inside the Great Red Spot increasing as the storm shrinks, like an ice skater who spins faster as she pulls in her arms.\n",

            "[00:01:12] Data reveals the storm isn't spinning faster. It’s actually getting taller.\n",
            "[00:01:17] You can think of it like working with pottery. As the wide lump of clay spins, forces within are driving it taller. \n",
            "[00:01:24] So from our perspective, looking down on the clouds, we see the spot getting smaller and rounder. \n",
            "[00:01:30] The Great Red Spot used to be big enough to fit three Earths. Now, it's just a little over one.\n",
